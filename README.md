## üß† Abstract

The rapid growth of **wireless communication technologies** such as **4G** and **5G** has created a demand for high-speed and reliable data transmission systems. To ensure error-free communication over noisy channels, **Forward Error Correction (FEC)** techniques play a crucial role. Among various FEC methods, **Turbo Codes** have emerged as a powerful coding scheme capable of achieving **near-Shannon limit performance**.

This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a pipelined Turbo Encoder and Decoder architecture** optimized for **high throughput and low latency**, addressing the challenges of modern high-speed communication systems.

The proposed architecture utilizes the **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)** and **Max-Log-MAP** algorithms to improve decoding accuracy and efficiency. A **serial pipelined structure** has been introduced in both the encoder and decoder modules to enhance data processing speed and minimize delay without compromising decoding performance. The **Turbo Encoder** consists of two **Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC)** encoders and a **pseudorandom interleaver**, while the **Turbo Decoder** employs two **Soft-In Soft-Out (SISO)** decoders that iteratively exchange information for accurate error correction.

The complete system is **modeled and simulated using Verilog HDL** and verified through **ModelSim** and **MATLAB** environments. The synthesized design using **Xilinx ISE** demonstrates efficient hardware utilization, reduced area, and improved data throughput compared to conventional architectures. Simulation results confirm that the pipelined implementation significantly lowers latency while maintaining reliable error correction performance across various noise levels.

This project showcases the successful realization of an efficient **Turbo coding system** that achieves real-time error detection and correction with high precision. The outcomes validate that a **pipelined Turbo Encoder and Decoder** design can meet the stringent requirements of next-generation communication networks, offering a practical solution for applications demanding **high-speed, energy-efficient, and reliable data transmission**.

In conclusion, the proposed architecture provides a **scalable and optimized design** for wireless systems, with potential extensions toward **ASIC implementation**, **6G communication**, and domains such as **satellite** and **IoT-based communication systems**.
